## LLMNR
- LLMNR poisoning gets you the NTLMv2 hash, which is the password hash of the AD network and you can crack it
## SMB Relay
- SMB relay on the other had dumps the SAM file which contain all the local hashes (its just like /etc/shadow)
- SMB relay worked because:
  - smb signing enabled but not required
  - targets contained PSiderman pc but the event was triggered by fcastle
  - We relayed fcastle's smb auth packet (containing the hash) to Spiderman as smb signing is not checked
  - fcastle was an admin on the Spiderman machine, so we dumped sam file of Spiderman
- To do interactive shell with smb relay you will get a ip:port on ntlmrelayx console output
